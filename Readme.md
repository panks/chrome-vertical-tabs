Chrome vertical tab manager extension

* Implements vertical tabs.
* Allows for grouping of tabs.
* Groups can be named.
* There should be a button like "New Group" in the extension's interface AND a right-click context menu on a tab to create and add it to a new group.
* All of tabs in a group can be deleted all at once.
* A new tabs is opened in the groups of the current tab.
* If current tab is ungrouped then the new tab should also be ungrouped.
* Tabs are shown in a side bar, that can be moved from left to right, resized or hidden.
* Existing tabs can be moved to new groups by drag and drop.
When we delete a group all the tabs in that group should be permanently closed.
* The extension runs entirely locally.
* Tab groups and their names don't have to be persistent. We don't need to store them if the Chrome is closed.
